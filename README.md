<h2>Memory</h2>
I made a memory game using python. The graphical user interface has been made with PyQt5. 

In order to use the code you must have: 
* python version: 3.5 
* PyQt5 version: 5.15.0
When the code is downloaded, change the path in memory_model.py to a path you want. Afterwards, open the source_gui.py and the game should work. 

Things that could be added to make it a more polished and robust game:
1. Add the option for cards to display words or images.
2. Ensure that the local database can be installed on every computer.
3. Create an executable/publish the first version of the game. 
4. It would be cool if there would be a unique theme. So the buttons would look unique and stuff. 
5. Add a test file to see if the game works as it should. 
6. The code in the playfield_gui is in the starting stage of becoming spaghetti code. I should go through it again and make it more readable.
